BIM Visualisation Interface

I was unsuccessful in implementing textures onto the 3d model.

Initially, the idea was to have two pages (one with the models and one with the schedules), however, this was not possible due to issues I could not solve around the models not showing up. EDIT: I found a way to work around this problem by using a banner at the top of the page.
